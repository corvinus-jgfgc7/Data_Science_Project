GENERAL PROJECT INFORMATION

PROJECT NAME	Digital Marketing Analysis
PROJECT MANAGER	Cintia Várhegyi	CHIEF DATA ENGINEER Péter Vándor
PROJECT OVERVIEW

PROBLEM OR ISSUE:

Currently, we lack a comprehensive data-driven approach to predict which users are most likely to convert. This lack of predictive insight makes it difficult to optimize campaigns, allocate resources effectively, and improve customer targeting, leading to suboptimal marketing spend and potentially lower conversion rates.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the likelihood of a user converting based on various digital marketing touchpoints, user behaviors, and demographic data. Predict conversion rates through customer engagement data and historical data to improve targeted marketing campaigns. Analyze how different type of campaigns affect the performance and recommend campaign types and channels.

BUSINESS CASE:

The insights generated from our in-house development will enable the optimization of targeted campaigns, recommend effective campaign types and channels, and drive ROI for digital marketing efforts. By optimizing targeting precision, we expect to increase conversion rates by 15-20%. By determining how many campaigns should be started from the current 4 types, the current distribution of advertisement spending can be improved and thus improve ROI. ML-driven allocation of the annual marketing budget will ensure maximum ROI across channels, with projected efficiency gains of 20-25%.

GOALS / METRICS:
	
One of the key performance indicators (KPIs) is the conversion rate, which measures how well our marketing efforts translate into desired actions by users (e.g., purchases, sign-ups, etc.). Our goal is to reach at least 95% accuracy in the model development phase while minimizing false positives.
EXPECTED DELIVERABLES	Multiple working machine learning models and a neural network model. Baseline model: Logistic regression. Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network.


PROJECT SCOPE

WITHIN SCOPE:	

Chief Data Engineer and project managers will work on building machine learning models to predict conversion likelihood. Analyzing user behavior data, demographic information, and interaction history to predict conversions for online marketing campaigns (paid ads, social media, SEO, email etc.)

OUTSIDE OF SCOPE:	

This project will not focus on offline marketing efforts such as TV ads, radio campaigns, print media, or event-based marketing. The scope is limited to digital marketing channels. 
Data that is not directly available from internal marketing systems or channels (such as data from third-party platforms like Google Analytics, social media analytics, or third-party CRM systems) is out of scope.
The project team will not be responsible for the handling of personal data, as this responsibility is ensured by the company’s existing data privacy and legal compliance protocols.
